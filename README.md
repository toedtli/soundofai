# Git Tutorial
## TL;DR
Here we give some guidelines on how to manage and contribute your code to the [Sound of AI Github](https://github.com/TheSoundOfAIOSR/thesoundofaiosr.github.io).
### Preliminaries
This document is in the making- we welcome suggestions for changes! Links currently refer to [my personal git repo](https://github.com/toedtli/soundofai), but tell me if this is still so when it shoudldn't anymore!

## Structure of the sound of ai git
In the text2sound working group, we'll have the following directory structure:

      └───text2sound-subgroup
            ├───playground
            │   ├───user1
            │   └───user2
            └───production
     └───other subgroups 
### Where to place your code
- Please place all your code in your own user directory. 
- You are free to manage your subfolder as you like, but please be careful not to push changes to other user's folders!
- Please create a Readme.md file in your directory- a text file describing the contents of your subfolder. 

### Getting started with git - experts skip this
Git is a widely used versioning control system. [Lots of tutorials](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/) exist. If you have any troubles starting (and are part of the sound of ai community), [contact me](beat.toedtli@ost.ch) any time.

### Setting up and Using the sound-of-ai repo: useful commands for everyone
Please use a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/) template for your directory structure if possible. The [data science template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) might be useful:

	#activate your local virtual environment if you have one, then:
	cd text2sound-subgroup\playground\<yourfamilyname>
	pip install cookiecutter
	cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science

You'll next fill in some data. What they call `repo_name` will be the name of your new subfolder, `project_name` will be in the title of the README.md of your new subfolder. Please have a look at that file's content. If suitable, follow their suggestions. 

#### Git commands
Please configure your local git installation to indicate your name and email addess:

    git config --global user.name "<Your-Full-Name>"
    git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

Then clone the existing repository into your desired folder

    cd your_desired_folder
    git clone git@github.com:toedtli/soundofai.git
    
you'll get a subfolder `soundofai`. Add your directory (and files) at the right location:

    cd text2sound-subgroup\playground
    mkdir <yourfamilyname>

Commiting files is done by "adding" them locally to your staging area, committing them into your local repository, then pushing them to the remote repository:

    cd <yourfamilyname>
    # (create some files here, e.g. embeddings.ipynb)
    git add embeddings.ipynb
    
At this point it is useful use `git status` to check that you are *not committing files you should not change*, e.g. files in other user's subdirectories.

    git commit -m "Write your commit message here"
    git push

If you get an error message 

    fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
    To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main`
    git push

then this is your chance to give your branch a meaningful name! use `yourname_topic`, and enter 
    
    git push --set-upstream origin replacethiswithyourfamilyname_replacethiswithausefulstring

If you get

    git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.
